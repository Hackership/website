	            <p>The Hackership Mentoring Programme is one more part of our endeavours to <strong>help developers stay curious, and keep learning. </strong>
				It is a Mentorship Programme for developers (first off, women) to get one-on-one career advice and insights from those who have walked the paths they want to, before them. 
				It is a chance to build networks, reflect, engage and most of all <strong>LEARN. </strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				As with our full time Hackership Learning Programme, <strong>the focus will be on self-directed learning, with the mentee in control, encouraged, and in the driving seat.</strong>

		        <h4>Who is it for?</h4>
		           <p>The first run of this programme will be explicitly for <strong> female mentees.</strong> This is because closing the gender gap in tech is a key focus for us right now. Mentors are comprised of brilliant female and male developers. This is because we know <strong>anyone can be and everyone should be an ambassador for equality. </strong>

	        <h4>Why we think mentoring is important</h4>
	            <p>So many  reasons!  Primarily, simply to support everyone involved <strong>to keep developing their programming craft and keep learning.</strong> Not everyone can take time out to complete a full time Hackership, we know this. </p>

				<p>It is specifically for women because we want  <strong>to empower female developers, and to stop the flow of women out of tech.</strong> This brain-drain is a problem, particularly as you get higher and higher up the industry. Giving existing female developers other support networks in the industry is one way to combat this.</p>

				<p>So too is <strong>creating a community of advocates for equality in the workplace who are sensitised to the issues at hand, aware of exactly what can be done to tackle this, and are willing to take action. </strong>  </p>
