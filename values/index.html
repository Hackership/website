            <p>“Code schools can provide a pathway into a heavily gated industry, and even the ability to cross class lines or overcome institutionalized boundaries. However, for this pathway to be effective, school officials must implement robust and transparent policies, unbiased admission standards, and instructor vetting processes. To keep schools accountable for their outcomes, school officials, states, and students must work toward licensed schools that actively seek to overcome institutionalized bias in their organizations and their graduates.”</p>
