      <p> Hackership is made possible by our <strong>amazing community support </strong>and unique structure. Hackership is a grass roots community initiative, where many talented people and organisations volunteer their time, incredible expertise and resources. (If you were to pay all of our people and space costs at the market rate, the programme would easily cost over 15 000 Eur per participant, and therefore, not exist.) We do this because we love it. </p>
      <p> For the day-to-day we rely on these three organizers:</p>
