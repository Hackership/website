<h1>Get Involved</h1>

<p>There are so many ways for you to get involved with the Hackership, other than applying as a learner. Here they are:</p>

        <h3>Become a Hacker in Residence</h3>
    </header>

    <p>You can register your interest to be a <strong>Hacker in Residence</strong> (for this next Batch, or a future one).</p>
    <p> Our Hackers in Residence freelance from the space, whilst making themselves available to answer learners questions, and tell us that it is a fun and fulfilling experience. So if you know you enjoy helping people understand and engage with programming and are interested to spend 9 weeks somewhere sunny, fill in the  form below!</p>
    <p> If you join us for Batch-2, we will cover your flights and accommodation costs, and perhaps more.</p>

        <h3>Sponsor a Grant</h3>
    </header>

    <p>You can donate to our <strong>Seats Based Sponsorship Programme</strong>, supporting the promotion of diversity in tech and/or the study of a particular  technology during the Batch. For instance, the Hackership has had a 40% female intake in each Batch, and we want to keep it that way, and improve this ratio even further! We would love to be able to offer tuition-fee waivers to applicants who are underrepresented in the programming field - please help us!</p>

    <p>With the 5k we are raising per grant, we will be available to cover the tuition fees, flights and living costs for one person to attend the programme. As the donor, you can decide to bind the grant to the learners focussing on a certain technology or be of an underrepsented group in tech. grants are given in a first-come first-serve basis to those eligable. You can choose (in the form), what should happen in case your grant won't taken.</p>

    <p>All grant sponsors will be featured on the bottom of our website (details in the form), as well as will be introduced to the learner they sponsored at the end of the programme.</p>

        <h3>Help us find a place</h3>
    </header>

    <p>We are currently sourcing the accommodation and workspace for Batch-2. Perhaps you have tips/ suggestions (or own a villa on a beach?)</p>
    <p>Further more, Hackership is sponsored based and looks for a home. So even if the space wouldn't be available for this batch yet, but for future ones or you'd like to host us in the future, please go ahead and let us know!</p>
