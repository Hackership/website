        <h4>Increase Diversity in Tech. Grants Progamme. </h4>
        <p>You can donate to our <strong>Grants Programme</strong>, supporting the promotion of diversity in tech and/or the study of a particular  technology during the Batch. For instance, the Hackership has had a 40% female intake in each Batch, and we want to keep it that way, and improve this ratio even further! Please help us!</p>

        <p>All grant sponsors will be featured on the bottom of our website (details in the form), as well as will be introduced to the Batch participants in which they sponsor </p>

            <h4>Become a Coach</h4>
            <p>You can register your interest to be a <strong>Coach</strong> (for this next Batch, or a future one).</p>
            <p> Our Coaches freelance from the space, whilst making themselves available to answer learners questions, and tell us that it is a fun and fulfilling experience. So if you know you enjoy helping people understand and engage with programming and are interested to spend 9 weeks somewhere sunny and stimulating, with motivated peers,  fill in the  form below!</p>
            <p>We cover your flights and accommodation costs, but otherwise, Coaches participate on a community, voluntary basis. We will never be able to compete with market rates for developers. </p>
