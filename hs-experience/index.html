         <p>This is a self-directed learning programme. You apply with a technology learning goal and a project that you want to carry out, and we provide skilled, relevant Hackers to coach and support you, whilst learning. 
        <br />
        This  puts you in control of the speed and direction of your learning, and focuses on ‘learning through building’ because we believe that this is how people best learn. (Rather than simply working through a pre- defined set of  ‘build-it tutorials’.)

                "I'm surprised at the rapid pace that you learn when working on a project that you set out for yourself. This was for me quite a departure from doing tutorial exercises or cliche programs like a todo list web app. It showed me how much independence you can have when programming your own stuff.
                <br />
                <br />
                But what I cherish most are the invaluable pieces of advice we gave each other. We very quickly moved from relying only on the coaches to depending on the other learners. We saved each other weeks of headache by asking the expertise of another.”</p>

        <h4>Programme information</h4>
        <p>The process is Iterative: You apply to Hackership with learning goals (and also ideally a technology and framework focus, and a project you want to work on.)
        <br />
        During the Application Process  you will develop a draft project plan for the time period. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Project Plan Reviewed by our Coaches. Feedback and Support to finalise it is given. 
        Start Learning! As you go through the programme, expect to refer back to, and occasionally readjust your  roadmap. 
        <br />
        In addition,  we provide a number of structures to best help facilitate and enhance your learning: 
        </p>

        <ul class="hs-list">
            <li>Each Monday: <span style="color:black;">A planning Breakfast where every learner details what they will work on that week.</span></li>
            <br />
            <li>Each Day: <span style="color:black;">A 10minute standup meeting with the whole group. Every learner lists their plan for the day, and whether or not they acheived their goals from the previous day. Suggestions to pair  or meet with a particular coach on a problem are made accordingly</span></li>
            <br />
            <li>Each Tuesday: <span style="color:black;">A slot for a skill share workshop, from either coaches or learners</span></li>
            <br />
            <li>Each Wednesday: <span style="color:black;">A group lunch for sharing and problem shooting</span></li>
            <br />
            <li>Each Thursday: <span style="color:black;">Demo time. Every learner presents on what they have studied, learnt and built that week, showing the code, and the progress their project has made.</span></li>
            <br /> 
            <li>Every 1-2 weeks: <span style="color:black;">Evening workshops and extras, also open to the public 
             Anytime: ask a coach for help! Code Reviews, Pair Programming, CV Consultation and Practice Interviews. Workshops on technical and non-technical developer skills</span></li>
        </ul>
