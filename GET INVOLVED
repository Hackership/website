        <h2>Want to Get Involved with the Hackership?</h2>
        <p>There are so many ways for you to get involved with the Hackership, other than applying as a learner.<p/>

        <h3 id="hacker in residence">Become a Hacker in Residence</h3>
        <p>You can register your interest to be a Hacker in Residence (for this next Batch, or a future one). Our Hackers in Residence freelance from the space, whilst making themselves available to answer learners questions, and tell us that it is a fun and fulfilling experience. So if you know you enjoy helping people understand and engage with programming and are interested to spend 9 weeks somewhere sunny, drop us a line!</p>

        <h3 id="sponsorship">Support a Student</h3>
        <p>You can donate to our Seats Based Sponsorship Programme, supporting the promotion of diversity in tech and/or the study of a particular  technology in the next Batch. For instance, the Hackership has had a 40% female intake in each Batch, and we want to improve this ratio even further!<p/>
        <p>We would love to be able to offer tuition-fee waivers to applicants who are underrepresented in the programming field. Please help us!<p/>

        <h3 id="space">Space</h3>
        <p>We are currently sourcing the accommodation and workspace for Batch-2, and beyond. Perhaps you have tips/ suggestions (or own a villa on a beach?)</p>

        <h3 id="share">Spread the Word</h3>
        <p>We are currently <a href="#apply-form">open for Applications</a>. If you know an awesome potential candidate, encourage them to apply! Or maybe you have a website/blog/meetup where you can spread the word?</p>
        
        <p>For all of the above, email team@hackership.org   We'd love to hear from you!
