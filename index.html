                        <p>Hackership will be run in <em>Berlin, Germany</em>. We are currently trying to secure a venue for our first iteration. Please stay tuned until then.
                        </p>

                        <h3>When does it start?</h3>
                        <p>The first batch is scheduled for <em>Winter 2013/2014</em>. We are not yet accepting applications because we are still unclear about the actual venue and therefore how many learners we can host. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
                        <p>Hackership is run on the <em>15-of-1st-alumni support model</em>. That means attending the Hackership programme is free of charge because all <em>alumnis are giving 15% of their monthly income over the 1st year</em> after the programme. Assuming they found a paid job or position.

                        <p>You will be informed whether you are in or not at least two month before the batch starts.</p>

                    <section>

                        <h3>Will it help me find a job?</h3>
                        <p>Yes and no. It is not a recruiting thing and the focus is not towards jobs but becoming a better programmer. That said, of course you'll meet great other learners and there is a <em>high interest in Hackership Alumni from Industry</em>. Aside from the amazing <a href="#faq-hackers-in-residence">Hackers in residence</a>, you'll code along side, who already got to know you and might want to stay in touch. Oh and than there is that whole becoming-better-at-coding thing, which - hopefully - makes you a better programmer and therefore a more interesting hire. 
                        </p>
                        <p>On top, the Hackership Team consists of very connected community people. So if you are quitting your job to attend, just let them know and they'll do their best to help you out.
                        </p>

                        <h3>So, what will the next batch be about?</h3>
                        <p>We don't know. And we don't decide that before hand. That is totally up to the applicants and what makes sense with that group. But we never predetermine what it should be about.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Then, when do prepare the material?</h3>
                        <p>This is a non-structured, self-directed programme. That means, there is no learning material provided by Hackership but the learners figure out what to learn while they go. Of course this is under direction and with help of the Hackership Team, but generally under your own supervision.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What language is it in?</h3>
                        <p>We really don't care about your language or background, it is about what you want to learn that matter. If you are c++ Windows-ERP-Architect, who wants to learn mobile or a frontend developer, who is into highly scaling database systems. What ever you want to learn and where ever you come from, we'll try to match it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>Oh, you mean as in natural language, well, the main language is <em>bad english</em>. But specifically that depends on the group of people you end up learning with. If another language works for you, great then. But the fallback is always bad english.</p>

                        <h3>But I'm not much of a hacker yet...</h3>
                        <p>That is totally fine. This programme is open for everyone to apply. You should just be far enough to be able to learn self-directed, have a passion for programming and need to know what you want to learn. If you can show us all of that and it fits the rest of the learning group, you are in.
                        </p>

                        <h3>I know my tech but need help on the soft-skills...</h3>
                        <p>That's great. This programme isn't only about acquiring hard-skills and learn about technology but also to catch up on soft-skills. Maybe you want to learn more about how to work in a team, then joining a group, which is trying to work on a project together will help you. Just mention it during the interview.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="faq-hackers-in-residence">What are "Hackers in Residence"?</h3>
                        <p>Hackers in residence are <em>experts</em> in a field, technology or method, who spent some time at hackership <em>hacking along side you</em>, are approachable for questions and generally help you to digg deeper into the tech. They are <em>picked and invited depending on learners needs</em> and spent at least a couple of days to get you really deep in the mudd.</p>
                        <p>For example a group might be interested and working on NoSQL-Database but two weeks in they are through every tutorial, played with every database and generally exceeded the limit. So Hackership invites someone developing on the core of one of those databases to come to make you understand the real stuff in-depth by hacking together, for example how replication really works under the hood.</p>

                        <h3>It reminds me of Hacker School in New York...</h3>
                        <p>Smart kid. Yes, this programme is inspired by <a href="http://hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> and their great work over in New York. And we are building this on top of their experience and what worked for them (like methods, group size, etc).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Who's behind all this?</h3>
                        <p>This programme was developed and is run by the Founders of <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org">OpenTechSchool</a> under which umbrella it is also running for now.
