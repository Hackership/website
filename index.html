                    "I work as a Junior Rails Developer in Berlin and I applied to Hackership as a <strong>professional development opportunity</strong>.The idea to join Hackership or a similar project was in my mind for a while, because I want to keep learning and work on my programming craft. I work as a developer, hence I feel good with Rails itself, but I was missing the time and environment to focus on programming languages and get more comfortable with real back-end work, ideally without using any framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The learning style of Hackership made perfect sense to me. <strong>My whole programming journey to date has been self-directed</strong>. My formal education is in Finance, not ICT.
                    </p>
                     <p> <strong>With support from Hackership Coaches in the application process, I came up with a learning project that fitted my goals.</strong> I focussed on developing my own simple programming language and building a compiler. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <p> <strong>With support from Hackership Coaches in the application process, I came up with a learning project that fitted my goals.</strong> I focussed on developing my own simple programming language and building a compiler. 
                    </p><p>This gave me time to delve into Ruby the language, as well as fundamentals of Computer Science like algorithms and data structures, providing plenty of opportunity to learn about parsing algorithms, abstract syntax trees, etc.
                     </p>
                    <p>
                    Various <strong>workshops organised during the batch </strong>helped me to fill the gaps of knowledge and created the environment where I could ask anything that was bugging me about certain technologies, good practices, general concerns etc. I also found the group of people very interesting and inspiring. Now I feel more confident about my skills and started to see my career path more clearly with the goal of becoming a true digital nomad.”

            <p> I am from the U.S., a historian by training, and I also have a background and experience with programming. I am aiming to merge these two fields, and explore the intersection of scholarship and coding -- a field loosely defined as "digital humanities." During the program, I expect to be working on a web application for scholars to discover and write book reviews. In any case, I'm looking forward to this experience, and to meeting the rest of you.</p>

            <p> I've been programming iOS apps for the last couple of years. I applied to HS because I wanted to learn functional programming and really get into test driven development. I liked the idea of an environment that minimizes distractions and brings together likeminded people. I learn and work a lot better together with other people than solely on my own. Plus sharing my own knowledge and experience with interested people is  important to me. 
            <br />It's also been great to to get back to surfing some waves on the weekend!
