                        <p>Hackership will be run in <em>Berlin, Germany</em>. We are currently trying to secure a venue for our first iteration. Please stay tuned until then.
                        </p>

                        <h3>When does it start?</h3>
                        <p>The first batch is scheduled for <em>Winter 2013/2014</em>. We are not yet accepting applications because we are still unclear about the actual venue and therefore how many learners we can host.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
                        <p>Hackership is run on the <em>15-of-1st-alumni support model</em>. Attending Hackership is free of charge because the <em>alumnis donate 15% of their monthly income over the 1st year</em> after the programme. Assuming they found a paid job or position.

                        <h3>When is the next batch starting?</h3>
                        <p>We plan to have the first public batch start in Fabruary 2014. We'll announce it in time over the newsletter.</p>

                        <h3>When are the batches?</h3>
                        <p>We plan to run multiple 12-week batches per year. The dates are not yet known. But we will update you as soon as we do.</p>

                        <h3>When do applications open?</h3>
                        <p>As soon as we have secured the space.</p>

                        <h3>How does the application process work?</h3>
                        <p>A brief written application by filling the application form, followed by two rounds of short interviews.</p>

                        <h3>What's the admissions timeline?</h3>
                        <p>The plan is to have you informed early enough to be able to sort all things out, which should be two month before the batch starts. That said, we can give you more precise dates once we know when the batches will start.<p>

                        <h3>Where is Hackership?</h3>
                        <p>Hackership will be run in Berlin/Germany.</p>

                        <h3>Can I visit Hackership?</h3>
                        <p>Most likely not. Our focus is on running a great learning programme in a distraction-free environment and as we have a only limited amount of space, the priority goes to the learners and hackers in residence.</p>

                        <h3>What is the time commitment?</h3>
                        <p>Hackership runs for 12 weeks. We expect all learners to be present in the space full-time from Monday to Thursday. There might be obligatory evening as well as weekend events.<p>

                        <h3>Do I have to be in Berlin?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, you need to be in Berlin to attend Hackership. That said, on days without an official schedule (the majority of Fridays to Sundays) you can leave Berlin if you want.</p>

                        <h3>Do I have to be German Citizen to take part?</h3>
                        <p>No, you just need to be able to stay in Berlin for the full time of the programme. So if you are a EU-Citizen or within the Schengen-Countries you should be able to do that without any problems. Otherwise you might need a Visa but that still doesn't exclude you from the programme.</p>

                        <h3>Do you sponsor visas?</h3>
                        <p>No, sorry :(</p>

                        <h3>What will the next batch be about?</h3>
                        <p>We do not set a direction regarding the content. This is up to the learners to decide themselves, either individually or in groups.
                          </p>

                        <h3>How do you learn without any instructors or formal teachers?</h3>
                        <p>This is a non-structured, self-directed learning programme. That means, there is no learning material provided by Hackership but the learners figure out what to learn themselves. Of course the Hackership Team is here to help and facilitate but you pick your direction.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Are there any lectures?</h3>
                        <p>Nope. We might host informal presentations by the <a href="#faq-hackers-in-residence">hackers in residency</a> though, but these will not be compulsory. The core focus is on self-directed learning from your pears, thus either in pairs or small groups.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What language is it in?</h3>
                        <p>The main language is English. But if another language works better for you in certain situations, great.</p>
                        <p>
                        As for programming , we don't care about your weapons of choice. Whatever you want to learn and wherever you come from, we'll try to match you with the right people.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How big is a Batch?</h3>
                        <p>We plan to have 40 learners per batch, but we might  change that number again. Eventually, we want to make sure that we can provide the best learning environment for all participants.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How old are learners?</h3>
                        <p>We don't have any restrictions on age. But we expect the majority of learners being from end twentieth to end thirties.</p>

                        <h3>I want to make a startup, should I attend?</h3>
                        <p>This programme does not help you acquire skills for starting or running a company but focusses on making you a better hacker. If that is what you are looking for to start your company, sure why not. But otherwise one of the many incubators is probably more helpful for you. Please keep in mind that during the programme we expect you to learn full-time, but not build a startup.</p>

                        <h3>I'm a freelancer. Can I do client work at Hackership?</h3>
                        <p>Nope. This programme focusses on learning together. You probably want to join a Coworking-Space for that instead.</p>

                        <h3>I don't know how to program. Can I join Hackership?</h3>
                        <p>No, sorry, this isn't a beginners programme. The <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org">OpenTechSchool</a> offers great ways to learn to code for beginners for free.</p>

                        <h3>But I'm not much of a hacker yet...</h3>
                        <p>That is fine. You just need to have programmed enough to know you love it. You should be far enough to be able to learn self-directed, be able to pick learning resource yourself and have a direction in which you want to learn more.</p>

                        <h3>I know my tech but need help on the soft-skills ...</h3>
                        <p>That's great. Even though this programme is mostly about hard-skills, you will be able to catch up on soft-skills like presentations, group work or interviewing as well.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="faq-hackers-in-residence">What are "Hackers in Residence"?</h3>
                        <p>Hackers in residence are <em>experts</em> in a field, technology or method, who spend some time in the Hackership space, <em>hacking along side you</em>. They are approachable for questions and generally help you to dig deeper into the tech. They are <em>picked and invited depending on learners needs</em> and spend at least a couple of days in the space.</p>
                        <p>For example a group might be interested in working with NoSQL-Databases. To aid the learning progress, Hackership would invite an expert (e.g. a core committer) as hacker in residence, who'd then hack together with the learners and provide in-depth knowledge for the group.
                        </p>

                        <h3>It reminds me of Hacker School in New York...</h3>
                        <p>Smart kid. Yes, this programme is inspired by <a href="http://hackerschool.com/">Hacker School</a> and their great work in New York. We are building this on top of their experience and what worked for them (like methods, group size, etc).
                        </p>

                        <h3>Will it help me find a job?</h3>
                        <p>Maybe. Hackership is not a recruiting platform but focused on becoming a better programmer. That being said, of course you'll meet great other learners and there is a <em>high interest in Hackership Alumni from Industry</em>. Besides, you'll code alongside amazing <a href="#faq-hackers-in-residence">Hackers in residence</a> who will get to know you and might want to stay in touch. And by focusing on becoming a better programmer you're also becoming a more interesting hire.
                        </p>
                        <p>On top, the Hackership Team consists of very connected community people. So if you are quitting your job to attend, just let them know and they'll do their best to help you out.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Do you offer scholarships?</h3>
                        <p>No, unfortunately we do not have the money for that.</p>

                        <h3>Does the Hackership grant a degree or certificate?</h3>

                        <h3>How much does Hackership cost?</h3>
                        <p>We don't charge any upfront tution. Hackership is run on the idea that people acquire skills and with them are offered better positions and jobs. That's why every participant pledges at the beginning of the programme to support future batches of Hackerschool with <em>15% of their first year salary</em> for one year after their batch ended.</p>

                        <h3>Who's behind all this?</h3>
                        <p>This programme was developed and is run by the Founders of <a href="http://www.opentechschool.org">OpenTechSchool</a> under which umbrella it is also running for now.
                        </p>

                        <h3>How are you funded?</h3>
                        <p>We are a community effort and bootstrapping this programme. For a few things we take minimal sponsoring but the goal is to be able to have this running sustainable primarily through alumni support and donations</p>

                        <h3>Any way I can help?</h3>
                        <p>We are currently on the lookout for a location to host a first trial batch, ideally with some office settings and internet existing already. Please contact us for details.</p>
                        <p>Aside from that, we are always happy for people to spread the word.<p>
