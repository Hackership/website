The Logo is all uppercase, one word, the word "hacker" being hs-green, the word "ship" being white. The background is hs-black.

Normal text is "Helvetica, Helvetica Neue" with a fallback to OpenSans in hs-black on white. In normal text Hackership is written one word, titled (as written here). To enforce the color-set of the brand, emphasis in the text aren't bold, underlined or italic but using the hs-green.

Links are underlined and in hs-blue.
