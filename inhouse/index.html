            <p>Aside from our 9-week batches we also run Inhouse trainings for companies - Hackership style!</p>

            <p>The ability to code benefits not just developers, but other members of your organisation as well. Some problems are solved with a phone call, others require lines of code. But most often, solving problems requires a mixture of different skills.</p>

            <p>We can help with that.</p>

            <p><strong>Trainings are based on our self-directed model, but can be tailored to your needs and desired outcome. Participants tell us that learning a new skill and coming up with a project that they execute from start to finish is extremely energising, even long after the training finishes.
