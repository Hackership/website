            <p>Aside from our 9-week batches we also run inhouse trainings for companies. </p>

            <p><strong>The ability to code benefits not just developers, but other members of your organisation as well</strong>. We provide the training necessary to get them from zero to finishing their first project - Hackership style!
            Next to that we offer advanced trainings for experienced developers who want to challenge themselves and learn something new.
            </p>
            <p>All our programs are based on our self-directed model, but can be tailored to your needs and desired outcome. Previous clients include <strong>Soundcloud</strong> and <strong>Qwinix Technologies</strong>. </p>
