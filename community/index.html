            <p>Hackership exists mostly due to the amazing, largely voluntary contributions of our coaches and organizers. We look for people who are passionate about helping others, exploring new territories, love what they do, and love learning themselves (and come without an inflated ego).</p>

            <p> To continue creating a safe environment for our learners, we make sure that all our coaches (whether technical or otherwise) are familiar with our coaching guidelines. You can fin these <a href="http://opentechschool.github.io/slides/presentations/coaching/">here</a>.
