            <h3 class="center-align">Community</h3>
            <p>Hackership exists due to the amazing and voluntary contributions of our community.  Everyone involved shares in common that they are passionate about helping and training others, exploring new territories,  love learning themselves and leave their ego at the door. 
            </p>
            <p>
            All the people below have supported Hackership and made it brlliant. They organised workshops, gave talks on a new framework, CV advice or useful programming soft skills. Some helped out as coaches, coaching one day a week or  pretty much full time during a Batch. They are Hackership Heroes.  Paying-it-forward. With patience, good humour and brilliance. Spreading knowledge, enthusiasm and creativity.  We thank them for that.

            <h4 class="center-left">Coaches</h4>
            <p> Our coaches are selected for their supportive style and warmth, and previous coaching experience, as much as for being superstars in their field. To get an idea of the coaching style at Hackership, check out our <a href="http://opentechschool.github.io/slides/presentations/coaching/">coaching guidelines here</a>. These guidelines help create a safe space. In addition we are very interested in the development of all our coaches, encourage feedback,  and for the more involved volunteers, have weekly coach check-ins and a coach onboarding and training weekend for each Batch. </p>
