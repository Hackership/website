            <h3>What Really Matters</h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to Hackership. <strong style="color:#20a260">We believe that life is a whole. lot.  better. when it is jam packed full of curiosity and opportunity to discover. </strong> 

            </p><p>Those moments when you feel the trepidation of a new challenge. The contemplation after a discussion introduces new ideas that alter and enrich your perspective. The  wonder at questions you now have that <span style="font-style:italic">you’d never even thought of asking</span> before. The brain- ache of new information and experiences all coming at you just a little faster than you can process. And the feeling of quiet pride when you recognise a step change in how you’re thinking, and what you are capable of. These are the moments of  connection and growth that enrich our daily life.</p>

            <p>
            <strong style="color:#20a260">Learning is exhilarating.</strong>

            Yes, continuous learning is a crucial component of being a great developer, as the environment and technology around us changes so quickly. But it is mainly a crucial component of being a great and happy person too. 

            We know learning  shouldn’t stop when you finish school, university or have a certain number of years’ experience behind you. But also that it can be hard to prioritise learning without support from the environment around you. So that is why, for developers, there is Hackership. <strong style="color:#20a260">Our mission is to support developers to stay curious, and keep learning. In an environment that is supportive, fun, open-minded and accessible. </strong></p>

            <p>Hackership is a value led initiative. Education should be affordable and accessible, not about profits. <strong style="color:#20a260">We are about learning and empowering everyone to become a learner. Individual. Life-long. Self-directed.</strong>
            These values shape everything we do.
            </p>
            <strong>We do, and will always strive to:</strong> 
            <ul class="hs-list">
                <li><span style="color:black">Publish our talks and resources open source and online.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:black">Support the  tech community wherever we run batches, for example through free and open talks and workshops.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:black">Support and Increase Diversity in tech.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:black">Keep the programme fee as affordable as possible.</span></li>
                <li><span style="color:black">Offer grants and needs-based programme fee loans.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            This is all made possible by our amazing community support and unique structure.  Hackership is a grass roots community initiative, where many talented people and organisations volunteer their time, incredible expertise and resources. (If you were to pay all of our people and space costs at the market rate, the programme would  easily cost over 15 000 Eur per participant, and therefore, not exist.)
            <strong style="color:#20a260">We do this because we love it.</strong></p>
