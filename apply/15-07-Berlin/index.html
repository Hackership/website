                <h4>Batch 15-07 Berlin, Germany</h4>
                <h5>July - Sept 2015</h5>
                <p> This summer we will return to our home turf, Berlin, for our fourth batch of Hackership. The batch will run from July 6th until September 3rd, 2015. The batch will run full time Monday - Thursday for 9 weeks, including one reading week.
                In case you’ve been living in a cave and haven’t heard, Berlin is a seriously amazing place. Not just for the low cost of living and huge tech and entrepreneurial scene there, but also for the nature, history, culture,  partying and more. Spend your weekdays with us, and your weekends dancing on a beach at an open-air techno party, cycling to and swimming in gorgeous lakes, while eating great and cheap food and meeting a whole host of liberal, crazy creative people. It will make you wonder WTF you are doing living anywhere else.

                <h4>Living Costs in Berlin</h4>
                <p>For approximate living costs, allow 750-1500 euro per month, depending on how you are accustomed to living, and how cheaply you rent accommodation. </p>

                <p><strong>Housing:</strong></br>A room in a shared apartment can be rented for between 300- 500 euro per month (most are around 350-500) See <a href="http://www.wg-gesucht.de">wg-gesucht</a> for availability. Kreuzberg, Mitte, Neukolln, Friedrichshain, Schoneberg and Prenzlauerberg tend to be the areas with the most listings and good choices. www.airbnb.com is usually more expensive but you can normally negotiate lower monthly rates too.</p>

                <p><strong>Transport:</strong></br> It is pretty easy in the Summer to get everywhere by bike, which you can pick up for 50-100 euro at a market or second hand bike shop. The subway costs 2.90 euro per ticket, with slightly cheaper tickets for shorter rides!</p>

                <p><strong>Food & Drinks:</strong></br> Both pretty cheap and, added bonus, in the summer a lot of drinking and eating happens in parks (so supermarket prices). If you prefer a restaurant instead expect to pay between 6-15 euro for a meal.</p>

                      We have partnered with Wooga and will be hosted at their offices in Berlin! If we had written a secret wishlist of everything we wanted for our next Hackership space, it would have looked just like what the awesome folks at Wooga are providing. Really!

                <p>
                    For 9 weeks, this Summer, we will be hosted on their first floor in Mitte, in a bright, airy and central space, complete with kitchen, a focussed work space for 40 people and of course, a ping pong table for those much needed breaks!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Wooga team is one of the most successful in mobile game development, with over 50 million people playing their free games every month across multiple platforms. More than just hosting us in a great space in a central location, we’re really happy to partner with a company that seems to have a very positive engineering culture.

                <h5>Message to Women!</h5>
                <p>The experience from our applications process confirms existing academic research on gender. Generally,  men are likely to over-estimate their talents and apply early. <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/08/why-women-dont-apply-for-jobs-unless-theyre-100-qualified/">Women under-estimate and delay</a>.</p>
                <p>
                So, if you are reading this and wondering whether to apply, the answer is yes. Apply. Now.  Not once you’ve studied a bit more. Not once you are a better programmer or your application is totally perfect. TODAY. <strong>Do not under-estimate your experiences and talents. </strong> </p>
