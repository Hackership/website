        <p>After you <a href="#apply-form">applied</a> for Hackership, the Team will contact you with further follow up questions. Once all the basics are clear, a few members of the Team (usually two: one male, one female) will schedule a Skype-Call/ Google+-Hangout with you to get to know you better and learn more about you and your fit in the upcoming batch.</p>
        <p>You will be informed whether you are in or not at least two month before the batch starts.</p>

        <h3 id="the-space">Where does it take place?</h3>
        <p>Hackership will be run in <em>Berlin, Germany</em>. We are currently trying to secure a venue for our first iteration. Please stay tuned until then.
        </p>

        <h3>When does it start?</h3>
        <p>The first batch is scheduled for <em>Winter 2013/2014</em>. We are not yet accepting applications because we are still unclear about the actual venue and therefore how many learners we can host.
        </p>

        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
        <p>We don't charge any upfront tution. Hackership is run on the idea that people acquire skills and with them are offered better positions and jobs. That's why every learner pledges at the beginning of the programme to support future batches of Hackership <em>by giving 15% of their income after taxes for the following twelve month</em> after their batch ended. Assuming they got a job or position in the field.</p>
