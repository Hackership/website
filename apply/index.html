                <h4>Grants and Loans</h4>
                <p>Grants and Loans are one way that we keep Hackership accessible to all. <strong>Because diversity rocks,</strong> we strive to have a truly diverse group of students, meaning that different age groups, genders and cultural backgrounds are represented. Our alumni is 40% female to date and we want to keep and improve this ratio. For each Batch of 30 Learners, we will offer 5- 10 full or partial, needs-based grants for women.
                </p>
                <p>
                In cases where you are not a woman, and cannot afford the programme fee, we will pay for your sex change so that you are then eligible for a grant. 
                </p>
                <p>
                A small number of programme fee loans (spreading the cost of the programme over a longer period) are also possible for those (men and women) who cannot afford the fee right now. See the Grants and Loans Application Form for more details.    
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Please note: </strong> All applications are processed on a rolling basis, and our Grants are allocated on a first come first served basis, for those eligible. When full, we will shut the grants application Form.
