        <h3 id="the-space">Where does it take place?</h3>
        <p>Hackership will be run in <em>Berlin, Germany</em>. We are currently trying to secure a venue for our first iteration. Please stay tuned until then.
        </p>

        <h3>When does it start?</h3>
        <p>The first batch is scheduled for <em>Winter 2013/2014</em>. We are not yet accepting applications because we are still unclear about the actual venue and therefore how many learners we can host.
        </p>

        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
        <p>Hackership is run on the <em>15-of-1st-alumni support model</em>. Attending Hackership is free of charge because the <em>alumnis donate 15% of their monthly income after taxes over the 1st year</em> after the programme. Assuming they found a paid job or position.
