    <section>
        <h3 id="the-space">Where does it take place?</h3>
        <p>We will leave Berlin for a Hackership on Tour. We will go to a more sunny and warmer place during the winter months.
        </p>

        <h3>When does it start?</h3>
        <p>This hasn't been decided yet, but we are aiming for the weeks of 2015.
        </p>

        <!-- <h3>I want to learn something else than 'web-based multimedia' though</h3>
        <p>Though we have an emphasis on <em>web-based multimedia</em>, you can still apply with any topic you want to learn. We will as usually try to match you with other learners having similar goals and ambitions. Having an emphasis for us mostly means, we already have coaches for that topic ready and are looking for people interest in these topics specifically.

        <h3>What does it cost?</h3>
        <p>We don't charge any upfront tution. Hackership is run on the idea that people acquire skills and with them are offered better positions and jobs. That's why every learner pledges at the beginning of the programme to support future batches of Hackership <em>by giving 15% of their income after taxes for the following twelve month</em> after their batch ended. Assuming they got a job or position in the field.</p> -->
