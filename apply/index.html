                <h4>Batch-3 Berlin, Germany</h4>
                <p> This summer we will return to our home turf, Berlin, for our fourth batch of Hackership. The batch will run from July 6th until September 3rd, 2015. The batch will run full time Monday - Thursday for 9 weeks, including one reading week. 
                In case you’ve been living in a cave and haven’t heard, Berlin is a seriously amazing place. Not just for the low cost of living and huge tech and entrepreneurial scene there, but also for the nature, history, culture,  partying and more. Spend your weekdays with us, and your weekends dancing on a beach at an open-air techno party, cycling to and swimming in gorgeous lakes, eating great and cheap food and meeting a whole host of liberal, crazy creative people that will make you wonder WTF you are doing living anywhere else. 
                <br />
                <p> <strong>Earlybird applications open March 1st 2015, (Earlybird cost 2450 Euro, Regular cost 2550 Euro) and close April 15th, at midnight (Berlin time), or when all places are allocated, whichever is sooner. Applications will be processed on a rolling basis.</strong></p>

                <p>After you <a href="#apply-form">applied</a> for Hackership, your application will be anonymized and reviewed by two of our reviewers. Within 10 days after applying you will receive an e-mail from us with follow-up questions. In order to keep the process moving, we ask you to please reply <strong>within 3 working days</strong>. 

                <p>Once we hear back from you, we will schedule a Skype call. These calls will typically be between you and the two reviewers. They are a chance for them to get to know you better and for you to ask questions about Hackership.</p>

                <p>Within 3 days after the Skype call you should know whether you are accepted. If you are, we ask you to transfer a non-refundable deposit to us (within one week), to confirm you participation.</p>

                <p>Please note there are a limited number of grants available per Batch and these are allocated on a rolling basis. When we are full, we will shut this stream.</p>

                <h4>Grants and Loans</h4>
                <p>Grants and Loans are one way that we keep Hackership accessible to all. <strong>Because diversity rocks,</strong> we strive to have a truly diverse group of students, meaning that different age groups, genders and cultural backgrounds are represented. Our alumni is 40% female to date and we want to keep and improve this ratio. For each Batch of 30 Learners, we will offer 5- 10 full or partial, needs-based grants for women.
                </p>
                <p>
                A small number of programme fee loans (spreading the cost of the programme over a longer period) are also possible for those (men and women) who cannot afford the fee right now. See the Grants and Loans Application Form for more details.    
                </p>
                <p>
                <strong>Please note: </strong> All applications are processed on a rolling basis, and our Grants are allocated on a first come first served basis, for those eligible. When full, we will shut the grants application Form.
